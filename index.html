    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people know me by my art and pictures. Other's know me for my writing and spoken word.
  I love to do many hobbies and most of them involve art. To face painting, painting, sketching, writing, singing and volunteering.
  I like to read, go on vacations and paint my nails. Moreover, I don't like coffee, but I perfer lemonade. A fun fact would be that I onced worked for an artist.
